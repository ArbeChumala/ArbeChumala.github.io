            <h2>Act 2 Scene 0.5</h2>

            <h4>Enter Hamlet, Marcellus, and Horatio, looking hurried and disheveled. They stop on the lawn of a large house</h4>

            <h3>Hamlet</h3>
            <p>On god that shit was crazy fam, like, no skibidi.</p>

            <h3>Horatio</h3>
            <p>No cap, brother.</p>

            <h3>Marcellus</h3>
            <p>For real.</p>

            <h3>Ghost (disembodied)</h3>
            <p>Stop slaying and start stabbing, Hamlet.</p>

            <h3>Hamlet</h3>
            <p>Alright guys, you're my buddies and all but I need some time alone to 'deal with this'—</p>

            <h3>Hamlet (aside)</h3>
            <p>Do drugs</p>

            <h3>Hamlet</h3>
            <p>—So I would appreciate it if you guys could head on out. But remember, you put it on the boys that you wouldn't tell anybody about what happened tonight. I had better not find out that you weren't straight with me!</p>

            <h4>Horatio and Marcellus exit abruptly as Hamlet shoos them away. After a reflective pause, Hamlet follows them out and turns down the street in the opposite direction. </h4>

            <h3>Hamlet</h3>
            <p>The bruzz can't keep their mouths shut, but ain't no way Uncle Claud is gonna think of me as a threat once he hears about the shit I'm about to pull off. The huzz all have big mouths but none bigger than this bird. Like, hear me out, she is my main squeeze and all, but that mouth does a lot—and nothing worthwhile. Ain't nothin like a daddy's girl. Once she sees me higher than a drunk eagle, they're gonna think I'm antic as fuck.</p>

            <h4>Hamlet pulls out a baggie of drugs and takes a large snort, then reacts with rapid erratic movements.</h4>

            <h3>Hamlet</h3>
            <p>WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO!!!</p>
            <p>It's kickinnnnn like roast chicken</p>
            <p>I've never been more pumped in my life</p>

            <h4>Hamlet pulls out his phone. It is clear that his hands are shaking. When he speaks, he is slurring his words slightly.</h4>

            <h3>Hamlet</h3>
            <p>Hey Siri, text Glorious Fling.</p>

            <h3>Siri (disembodied)</h3>
            <p>Ok, what would you like to say</p>

            <h3>Hamlet (slurred)</h3>
            <p>Get ready momma cause Santa is coming to town, and he's bringing the snow!</p>

            <h3>Siri (disembodied)</h3>
            <p>To Claudius, King:</p>
            <p>Get momma some Santa downtown, bring snow</p>
            <p>Send it?</p>

            <h3>Hamlet</h3>
            <p>Fuck Fuck Fuck No</p>

            <h3>Siri</h3>
            <p>Sent!</p>

            <h4>Hamlet runs to Ophelia's door and knocks, then waits for several seconds and climbs through a window. Through the window, Ophelia can be seen scrolling on TikTok. </h4>
            
            <h3>Ophelia (aside)</h3>
            <p>Who is this tweaker that I see before me?</p>
            
            <h4>Hamlet falls unceremoniously from the window onto a table, then springs to his feet and slicks back his unruly hair. The point of view is now from inside Ophelia's house. Ophelia is sitting in a chair beside the table Hamlet fell onto. She stands up abruptly.</h4>

            <h3>Hamlet</h3>
            <p>Sup girlllllll</p>

            <h3>Ophelia (aside)</h3>
            <p>Oh my god is he in heat?</p>
            <p>High, drunk, and he looks like he just got run over by a pack of angry squirrels</p>
            
            <h4>Ophelia rolls her eyes aggressively</h4>

            <h3>Ophelia (aside)</h3>
            <p>I wonder what he wants?</p>
            
            <h4>Hamlet begins grabbing Ophelia's arms, staring into her eyes, and acting creepy for an uncomfortable length of time.</h4>
            <h4>Ophelia tries to shake him off her arm and move backwards.</h4>
           
            <h3>Ophelia</h3>
            <p>Get the fuck off me!</p>

            <h4>Ophelia shakes Hamlet off and backs away, looking scared and uncertain. She positions herself between a small table and Hamlet.</h4>

            <h3>Ophelia (aside and distressed)</h3>
            <p>I ghost him for one day and he does this shit? How down bad is he?</p>
            
            <h4>Hamlet lets out a giant breath and turns around, miraculously backflipping through the window while keeping his eyes locked on Ophelia.</h4>
            <h4>[Exit Hamlet]</h4>

            <h4>Ophelia pinches herself, winces, and lets out a sob.</h4>
            
            <h3>Ophelia</h3>
            <p>Oh, how his disposition has become so antic! What could have possibly happened to turn Hamlet into a legit crackhead? What would he have done, had I not shaken him off my arm? At least the little brokey wasn't asking for cash… But I worry for him. How could I not feel guilty if I was the one who drove him into insanity? The one who blue balled him at his time of need—but only because I dutifully obeyed my father? I must tell my pops, he would surely know what to do.</p>
