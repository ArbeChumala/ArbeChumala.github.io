        <h2>Our Vision</h2>

        <h3>General Description</h3>

        <p>This rendition of Hamlet takes place in a modern setting where Hamlet turns to drugs in order to cope with the loss of his father and convince Ophelia and his uncle that he is taking leave of his senses. The debate over madness morphs into a reflection on addictionâ€”is Hamlet truly addicted, or is he simply maintaining the act? As can be seen in the artist's renditions, Hamlet's clothing reflects our modern times, and the modern-day slang emphasizes this element of the play. The play also adopts a modern 'nihilistic comedy,' poking fun at the seriousness of Hamlet's demeanor in the Shakespearean original.</p>

        <h3>Scene Description</h3>

        <p>This scene takes place directly after Hamlet and his friends leave behind the ghost of Hamlet's father and make their way back to Hamlet's home. It seeks to explain how he made the decision to go see Ophelia and what caused his bizarre behavior when he saw her, while also adding in several differences from Ophelia's recounting which forces the audience to question the reliability of her narration.</p>
